Project Title:
Restaurant Point-of-Sale (POS) System
Project Overview:

The goal of this project is to develop a Restaurant POS System using C++ and Object-
Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. This system will simulate the core functionality

of a real-world restaurant POS, including managing customer orders, calculating totals,
applying taxes, and generating itemized receipts.
Project Objectives:
• Efficient Order Management: Enable users to add and manage multiple orders
(e.g., food items, quantity, customization).
• Real-Time Billing: Calculate order totals, apply tax rates, and manage discounts or
tips (if applicable).
• Receipt Generation: Print an itemized receipt with customer details and final
amount for payment.
• User-Friendly Interface: Provide clear functions for adding products, calculating
totals, and processing payments.
Core Features:
1. Product Management:
o Add products to the menu with name, price, and product code.
o Track product quantities or special options (e.g., toppings in a restaurant).
2. Order Management:
o Create and manage customer orders.
o Add/remove products from an order.
o Calculate subtotals and apply tax.
3. Billing and Payment:
o Calculate the final total, including tax and optional discounts.
o Generate a detailed receipt for the customer.

4. Payment Methods (Optional Extension):
o Integrate multiple payment options, such as cash or credit card payment,
using polymorphism in C++.

Technology:
• Programming Language: C++ (Using Object-Oriented Programming)
• Core Concepts: Classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation
Project Scope:
• The initial version will focus on basic order management, total calculations, and
receipt generation.
• Future versions could extend the system with inventory management, customer
profiles, and report generation.
Expected Outcomes:
• A working Restaurant POS System that can handle typical restaurant order and
billing processes.
• Hands-on experience in applying OOP concepts (encapsulation, inheritance, and
polymorphism) in a real-world application.
• A scalable and modular system that can be expanded in the future to add new
features and integrations.
